# Todo app js

Todo app with pure JS and local server.

##### *As a user I should be able to:*

- create new Task
- complete my task by changing styles(can use ```text-decoration: line-through;``` or anything else)
- delete todo from the list

##### Bonus: 

*Make your data persist by using database*
- Send ```GET``` request to fetch todos
- Send ```POST``` request to create new todo
- Send ```PUT``` request to modify todo
- Send ```DELETE``` request to delete todo

- be creative and use css to make it nice :)

##### To run your app with server:

1. Run ```npm install```
2. Start your local server with ```json-server --watch db.json```
